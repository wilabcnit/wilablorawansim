# lorawansim

Public version of the LoRaWANSim can be found on: https://github.com/kvmikhayl/LoRaWAN_simulator

The simulator allows modelling a multi-GW LoRaWAN network and has been collaboratively developed by Riccardo Marini (WiLab, CNIT, Italy), Konstantin Mikhaylov (University of Oulu, Finland), Gianni Pasolini(University of Bologna, Italy) and Chiara Buratti(University of Bologna, Italy). The simulator design and evaluation are further detailed in the paper: Marini, R.; Mikhaylov, K.; Pasolini, G.; Buratti, C. LoRaWANSim: A Flexible Simulator for LoRaWAN Networks. Sensors 2021, 21, 695. https://doi.org/10.3390/s21030695 which is openly avialable from: https://www.mdpi.com/1424-8220/21/3/695/html. We would appreciate a reference to this paper in your paper, should you find this simulator useful for your studies (& also for tracking reasons) :)
